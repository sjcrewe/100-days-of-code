# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Reviewed Git command line basics
  2. Installed Node.js, configured Sublime build system, ported my FreeCodeCamp Algorithm solution to Sublime, for more experimentation
  3. Experimented with Python telnetlib, socket & pyvisa modules to query network devices

**Thoughts:** Struggled initially to get Python modules to communicate with network devices, frustrating!! Pleased with progress on Node.js & Sublime Javascript build system.

### Day 2: August 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Continued learning to use Git on the command line, 
  2. Started reading Eloquent Javascript(EJ) by Marijn Haverbeke, focussed on Data Structures & Objects.
  3. Worked through several exercises from EJ with Sublime & Node.js.
  4. Looked into productivity improvement techniques, focussed on Bullet Journaling, started using Pomodoro Clock, to break activities into bitesize chunks.


**Thoughts:** Less time to code today, but managed to download Eloquent Javascript Book & refresh myself on Data Structures and Objects. Felt a little overwhelmed with amount of material I **WANT** to learn. Encouraged by articles I found on bullet journaling, and Pomodoro clock techniques.

### Day 3: August 12, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. FreeCodeCamp Algorithms, Mutations, Falsy Bouncer & Seek & Destroy, 
  2. Created preliminary Bullet Journal template for productivity.


**Thoughts:** DIY on the Garden most of the day, but found a couple of hours to work through a few challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 4: August 13, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Reading up on Array.prototype methods used to solve FreeCodeCamp Algorithms 
  2. Ordered Eloquent Javascript Book to read on vacation.
  3. Sketching out structure for FCC Basic Front End Development Projects. 


**Thoughts:** A busy day landscaping the garden again, but set aside two hours to deep dive Array methods, to gain a greater understanding of what each method does. Made a start on the FCC Front End Dev Projects, with initial sketches of what I want the first project page to look like, based on required user stories.

### Day 5: August 14, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Started coding FCC Tribute Page to Tim Berner's Lee 


**Thoughts:** After leaving it so long to start the Tribute page found HTML knowledge was rusty. Had to refresh on tags and Bootstrap before coding.

### Day 6: August 15, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Worked on FCC Tribute Page to Tim Berner's Lee 


**Thoughts:** Much more enthusiastic about getting on with the coding, now that I've actually started...really enjoying it, dare I say more than the FCC challenges and tutorials.

### Day 7: August 16, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Minor updates to FCC Tribute Page.
  2. FCC Algorithm challenges, coded in Sublime using Node.js for testing.


**Thoughts:** Didn't have much cpare time today to work on the tribute page today, but managed to work through several code challenges on FCC.

### Day 8: August 17, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. FCC Algorithm challenges, specifically Caesars Cipher Algorithm.

**Thoughts:** First solution created again using sublime and Node.js for testing, but didn't seem to pass the tests of FreeCodeCamp. Need to understand what was wrong with this implementation.

### Day 9: August 18, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Comleted Caesars Cipher Algorithm.
  2. FreeCodeCamp JSON API's & AJAX.

**Thoughts:** On holiday tomorrow for a week, so had a lot to do today, but found a few hours to complete the Caesars Cipher algorithm and start looking at the JSON API's section on FCC. Downloaded Vim cheat sheet, with a view to getting to know it better and use it more. Sublime still seems to be easiest editor to use, with very light requirement on system resources. Vim requires the least amount of resources it seems, but  has a steep learning curve.

### Day 10: August 19, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. No coding today as travelling for vacation but managed to read up on a few HTML and CSS techniques.

**Thoughts:** No time for coding. A little frustrated with not having the time to get on with some hacking.

### Day 11: August 20, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Reading up on Parallax Effect.

**Thoughts:** Decided to re-visit my ideas for a tribute page and tackle something more challenging, incorprating the parallax effect into the design. Would also like to do a site on someone or something I find more inspiring, than original idea for a tribute page to Tim Berner's Lee....sorry Tim!

### Day 12: August 21, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Watched several Parallax Effect video tutorials, created initial test page.

**Thoughts:** Have concluded that I can't really take a vacation and commit to coding at the same time, so the rest of this week will have to be reading and watching video tutorials when I can, and getting up at 5am, before the kids so that I can get some coding done. Want to give the family my attention so coding has to be slotted in when I can.

### Day 13: August 22, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Researched material for Tribute Page, started planning story for the site. User story already defined by FCC.
  2. Completed JSON API challenges on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** Lagging behind now on projects. Need to knuckle down and get the first two done. Been delayed after deciding to find someone/something more inspirational and resaerching the parallax effect.

### Day 14: August 23, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Read Higher Order functions chapter in Eloquent Javascript (supporting yesterday's work on JSON API's).
  2. Worked through exercises from online version of Eloquent Javascript.
  3. Created repo with my solutions to Free Code Camp challenges.


**Thoughts:** All done today before 9am, starting the day at 6am with Hal Elrod's S.A.V.E.R.S routine. Still need to complete FCC projects, but feel like I've achieved something today, meeting my tragets so early on.

  3. Cloned github repos to laptop.


**Thoughts:** Once again all done before 9am; with the Miracle Morning routine done before tackling coding tasks.
