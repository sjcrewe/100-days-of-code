# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Reviewed Git command line basics
  2. Installed Node.js, configured Sublime build system, ported my FreeCodeCamp Algorithm solution to Sublime, for more experimentation
  3. Experimented with Python telnetlib, socket & pyvisa modules to query network devices

**Thoughts:** Struggled initially to get Python modules to communicate with network devices, frustrating!! Pleased with progress on Node.js & Sublime Javascript build system.
