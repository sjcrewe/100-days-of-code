# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Reviewed Git command line basics
  2. Installed Node.js, configured Sublime build system, ported my FreeCodeCamp Algorithm solution to Sublime, for more experimentation
  3. Experimented with Python telnetlib, socket & pyvisa modules to query network devices

**Thoughts:** Struggled initially to get Python modules to communicate with network devices, frustrating!! Pleased with progress on Node.js & Sublime Javascript build system.

### Day 2: August 12, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Continued learning to use Git on the command line, 
  2. Started reading Eloquent Javascript(EJ) by Marijn Haverbeke, focussed on Data Structures & Objects.
  3. Worked through several exercises from EJ with Sublime & Node.js.
  4. Looked into productivity improvement techniques, focussed on Bullet Journaling, started using Pomodoro Clock, to break activities into bitesize chunks.


**Thoughts:** Less time to code today, but managed to download Eloquent Javascript Book & refresh myself on Data Structures and Objects. Felt a little overwhelmed with amount of material I **WANT** to learn. Encouraged by articles I found on bullet journaling, and Pomodoro clock techniques.

**Today's Progress**: 
  1. FreeCodeCamp Algorithms, Mutations, Falsy Bouncer & Seek & Destroy, 
  2. Created preliminary Bullet Journal template for productivity.


**Thoughts:** DIY on the Garden most of the day, but found a couple of hours to work through a few challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 4: August 14, 2017


**Today's Progress**: 
  1. Reading up on Array.prototype methods used to solve FreeCodeCamp Algorithms 
  2. Ordered Eloquent Javascript Book to read on vacation.
  3. Sketching out structure for FCC Basic Front End Development Projects. 


**Thoughts:** A busy day landscaping the garden again, but set aside two hours to deep dive Array methods, to gain a greater understanding of what each method does. Made a start on the FCC Front End Dev Projects, with initial sketches of what I want the first project page to look like, based on required user stories.
